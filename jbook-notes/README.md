#### Jupyter Book notes

Jupyter Book is a slightly different thing from Jupyter Notebook. It is a based on the same sets of
tools. Jupyter Book allows you to create a web site serving a book like document that 
has embedded notebooks. The notebooks can be executed from within the document without an end user
having to install any software. The executable parts of a Jupyter Book launch a cloud based 
computing resource on demand, typically using the Binder system.
